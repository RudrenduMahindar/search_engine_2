# search_engine_2
Search engine version 2 uses a map(keyword,root_of_BST). The cmplete overview of the system is available [here](https://github.com/anujp10/qt_search_engine/blob/master/User_guide.pdf). 
This c++ search engine was created after the search_engine_1 in my repo. 
This is the final c++ backend portion of the [mini search engine](https://github.com/anujp10/qt_search_engine) submitted as a [course project](https://github.com/ourarash/EE599_SP2020_Final_Project) of [EE599:Computing and Software for Systems Engineers](https://web-app.usc.edu/soc/syllabus/20201/30586.pdf) under the guidance of [Professor Arash Saifhashemi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ourarash/). 
This c++ code was developed on Visual Studio Code with Bazel 3.0.0 on Ubuntu 16.04 inside a virtual machine in windows 10. 
This c++ code was integrated with Qt for the complete system and the final project is available [here](https://github.com/anujp10/qt_search_engine). 
For trying out this c++ code install Bazel and Visual Studio Code preferably inside Ubuntu.
For building C++ files, you can install Bazel using this [link](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html).
